Introduction
------------

GridIron is an event-driven C++ Apache/CGI Applications framework based on GNU CGICC, Boost and htmlcc. It features inheritable page and control classes and comes with an increasing set of controls.

When the decision was made to create GridIron, it was in spite of a couple of existing C++ frameworks. Most, if not all, of the frameworks require all of the page rendering to be done in C++. It can be frustrating when creating pages because everything that generated the pages had to happen in C++, resulting in hard to read code and unnecessary bloat.

GridIron hopes to keep the code size to the bare minimum necessary for computation and spare rendering code wherever possible. 

GridIron supports three ways of rendering data:
1) Entirely C++ originated code with no html page.
2) An HTML template with custom controls that match up with C++ code-behind.
3) Entirely HTML based pages with autonomous control tags that can perform tasks without any C++ code.
